## 4.5 Overriding Fields

Overriding fields is instrumental for creating class hierarchies. Many design patterns utilize overrides, but here we will explore only the basic functionality. In order to use overrides a class must inherit from a [parent class](2.3.2-Inheritance.md). Consider the following example:
```haxe
class Base {
	public function new() { }
	public function myMethod() {
		return "Base";
	}
}

class Child extends Base {
	public override function myMethod() {
		return "Child";
	}
}

class Main {
	static public function main() {
		var child:Base = new Child();
		trace(child.myMethod()); // Child
	}
}

```

The important components here are



* the class `Base` which has a method named `myMethod` and a constructor,
* the class `Child` which `extends Base` and also has a method `myMethod` being declared with `override`, and
* the `Main` class whose `main` method creates an instance of `Child`, assigns it to a variable `child` of explicit type `Base` and calls `myMethod()`.



The variable `child` is explicitly typed as `Base` to highlight an important difference: At compile-time the type is known to be `Base`, but the runtime still finds the correct field `myMethod` on class `Child`. This example shows that field access is resolved dynamically at runtime.
