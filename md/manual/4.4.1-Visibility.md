## 4.4.1 Visibility

Fields are by default **private**, meaning that only the class and its sub-classes may access them. They can be made **public** by using the `public` access modifier, allowing access from anywhere.

```
class MyClass {
	static public function available() {
		unavailable();
	}
	static private function unavailable() { }
}

class Main {
	static public function main() {
		MyClass.available();
		MyClass.unavailable(); // Cannot access private field unavailable
	}
}
```

Access to field `available` of class `MyClass` is allowed from within `Main` is allowed because it is denoted as being `public`. However, while access to field `unavailable` is allowed from within class `MyClass`, it is not allowed from within class `Main` because it is `private` (explicitly, although this identifier is redundant here).

The example demonstrates visibility through **static** fields, but the rules for member fields are equivalent. The following example demonstrates visibility behavior for when [manual/Inheritance] is involved.

```
class Base {
	public function new() { }
	private function baseField() { }
}

class Child1 extends Base {
	private function child1Field() { }
}

class Child2 extends Base {
	public function child2Field() {
		var child1 = new Child1();
		child1.baseField();
		child1.child1Field(); // Cannot access private field child1Field
	}
}

class Main {
	static public function main() { }
}
```

We can see that access to `child1.baseField()` is allowed from within `Child2` even though `child1` is of a different type, `Child1`. This is because the field is defined on their common ancestor class `Base`, contrary to field `child1Field` which can not be accessed from within `Child2`.

More fine-grained control of access can be achieved using [manual/Access_Control].

> Haxe has no notion of a `protected` keyword known from Java, C++ and other object-oriented languages. However, its `private` behavior is equal to those language's protected behavior, so Haxe actually lacks their real private behavior.
