## 3.4.1 Top-down Inference

Most of the time, types are inferred on their own and may then be unified with an expected type. In a few places, however, an expected type may be used to influence inference. We then speak of **top-down inference**.

> ##### Define: Expected Type

> Expected types occur when the type of an expression is known before that expression has been typed, e.g. because the expression is argument to a function call. They can influence typing of that expression through what is called [top-down inference](3.4.1-Top-down_Inference.md).


A good example are arrays of mixed types. As mentioned in [Dynamic](2.7-Dynamic.md), the compiler refuses `[1, "foo"]` because it cannot determine an element type. Employing top-down inference, this can be overcome:

```haxe
class Main {
	static public function main() {
		var a:Array<Dynamic> = [1, "foo"];
	}
}
```

Here, the compiler knows while typing `[1, "foo"]` that the expected type is `Array<Dynamic>`, so the element type is `Dynamic`. Instead of the usual unification behavior where the compiler would attempt (and fail) to determine a [common base type](3.3.5-Common_Base_Type.md), the individual elements are typed against and unified with `Dynamic`.
