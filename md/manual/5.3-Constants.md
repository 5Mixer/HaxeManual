## 5.3 Constants

The haxe syntax supports the following constants:



* Int: An [integer](dictionary.md#int), such as `0`, `1`, `97121`, `-12`, `0xFF0000`.
* Float: A [floating point number](dictionary.md#float), such as `0.0`, `1.`, `.3`, `-93.2`.
* String: A [string of characters](dictionary.md#string), such as `""`, `"foo"`, `"`, `'bar'`.
* true,false: A [boolean](dictionary.md#bool) value.
* null: The null value.



Furthermore, the internal syntax structure treats [identifiers](def:Identifier) as constants, which may be relevant when working with [macros](8-Macros.md).
