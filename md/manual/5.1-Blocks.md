## 5.1 Blocks

A block in haxe starts with an opening curly brace `{` and ends with a closing curly brace `}`. A block may contain several expressions, each of which is followed by a semicolon `;`. The general syntax is thus:

```haxe
{
	expr1;
	expr2;
	...
	exprN;
}
```
The value and by extension the type of a block-expression is equal to the value and the type of the last enclosed expression.

Blocks can contain local variables declared by [`var` expression](5.10-var.md), as well as local closures declared by [`function` expressions](5.9-Closure.md). These are available within the block and within sub-blocks, but not outside the block. Also, they are available only after their declaration. The following example uses `var`, but the same rules apply to `function` usage:

```haxe
{
	a; // error, a is not declared yet
	var a = 1; // declare a
	a; // ok, a was declared
	{
		a; // ok, a is available in sub-blocks
	}
	a; // ok, a is still available after sub-blocks
}
a; // error, a is not available outside
```
At runtime, blocks are evaluated from top to bottom. Control flow (e.g. [exceptions](5.16-try_catch_(exceptions).md) or [return expressions](5.17-return.md)) may leave a block before all expressions 
are evaluated.
