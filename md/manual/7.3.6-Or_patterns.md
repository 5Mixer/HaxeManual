## 7.3.6 Or patterns

The `|` operator can be used anywhere within patterns to describe multiple accepted patterns:

```
var match = switch(7) {
	case 4 | 1: "0";
	case 6 | 7: "1";
	case _: "2";
}
trace(match); // 1
```

If there's a captured variable in an or-pattern, it must appear in both its sub-patterns.
