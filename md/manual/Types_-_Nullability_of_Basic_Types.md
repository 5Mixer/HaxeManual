It is common for programming languages to have a single, clean definition for nullability, but haxe has to find a compromise in this regard. The reason for this is obvious when looking at the nature of haxe's target languages: While some of them allow and, in fact, default to `null` for anything, others do not even allow `null` for certain types. This necessitates the distinction of two types of target languages:




There is nothing to worry about when working with `null` on dynamic targets, but static ones may require some thought. For starters, basic types are initialized to these values:



* `0`
* `NaN` on Flash 9, `0.0` on other static targets
* `false`


As a consequence, the haxe compiler does not allow assigning `null` to a basic type on static targets. In order to achieve this, the basic type has to be wrapped as `Null$<$T$>$`:

```
var a:Int = null; // error on static platforms
var b:Null<Int> = null; // allowed
```
Similarly, basic types cannot be compared to `null` unless wrapped:

```
var a : Int = 0;
if( a == null ) { ... } // error on static platforms
var b : Null<Int> = 0;
if( b != null ) { ... } // allowed
```
This restriction extends to all situations where [[manual/Unification]] is performed.

If a `null`-value is "hidden" in `Null$<$T$>$` or `Dynamic` and assigned to a basic type, the default value is used:

```
var n : Null<Int> = null;
var a : Int = n;
trace(a); // 0 on static platforms
```
