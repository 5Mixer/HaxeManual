## 2.5.4 Impact on Performance

Using structures and by extension [structural subtyping](3.5.2-Structural_Subtyping.md) has no impact on performance when compiling to [dynamic targets](dictionary.md#dynamic-target). However, on [static targets](dictionary.md#static-target) a dynamic lookup has to be performed, which is typically slower than a static field access.
