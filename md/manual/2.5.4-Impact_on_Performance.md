## 2.5.4 Impact on Performance

Using structures and by extension [Structural Subtyping](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.3.2-Structural_Subtyping.md) has no impact on performance when compiling to dynamic targets ([Nullability of Basic Types](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.2-Nullability_of_Basic_Types.md)). However, on static targets ([Nullability of Basic Types](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.2-Nullability_of_Basic_Types.md)) a dynamic lookup has to be performed, which is typically slower than a static field access.
