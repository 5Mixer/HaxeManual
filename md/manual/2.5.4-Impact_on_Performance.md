## 2.5.4 Impact on Performance

Using structures and by extension [structural subtyping](3.3.2-Structural_Subtyping.md) has no impact on performance when compiling to [dynamic targets](2.2-Nullability_of_Basic_Types.md). However, on [static targets](2.2-Nullability_of_Basic_Types.md) a dynamic lookup has to be performed, which is typically slower than a static field access.
