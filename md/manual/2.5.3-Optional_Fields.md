## 2.5.3 Optional Fields

> I took a stab at it -- C.

A structure field can be made optional by placing a question mark before its name:
```haxe
function foo( pt : {?x : Int, ?y : Int}){
  //...
}
// all valid calls to foo()
foo({x : 1, y : 1});
foo({x : 1});
var tmp = {};
foo(tmp);
```
<

Optional fields are **nullable** (** < Null> Int** in the example).  Please note that optional fields only work for **anonymouse** structure values (i.e. structures that are not explicitly typed).
Since fields can be hidden, allowing arbitrary structures would break type safety.  As the example below demonstrates, it would be possible to pass in an incorrectly typed field:

> What is the failure here?  The compiler complains about the call to foo?
```haxe
var mixed : {x : String, y : Int} = {x : "Hello", y : 0};
var yonly : {y : Int } = mixed; //x is hidden
foo(yonly); // x is String being passed into an Int !!
```
