## 2.1 Basic Types

**Basic Types** include **Bool, Float, and Int**.  The basic types are **abstract types** tagged with **:coreType** metadata.  This means is they get replaced by platform specific types at compile-time.  Don't worry about all of the implmentation details at the moment, but feel free to see [Abstract](2.8-Abstract.md) and [Metadata](7.9-Metadata.md) for more details.  Just be aware that this abstraction can cause the [Overflow](2.1.2-Overflow.md) and [Nullability](2.2-Nullability.md) of Basic Types to behave differently on different target platforms.  To reiterate: **basic types can behave differently depending on the target platform.**
