## 7.9 Access Control

Access control can be used if the basic [visibility](4.4.1-Visibility.md) options are not sufficient. It is applicable at **class-level** and at **field-level** and knows two directions:



* Allowing access: The target is granted access to the given class or field by using the `:allow(target)` [metadata](7.8-Metadata.md).
* Forcing access: A target is forced to allow access to the given class or field by using the `:access(target)` [metadata](7.8-Metadata.md).
