## 4.1 Variable

We have already seen variable fields in several code examples of previous sections. Variable fields hold values, a characteristic which they share with most (but not all) properties:

```
class VariableField {
	static var member:String = "bar";
	
	public static function main() {
		trace(member);
		member = "foo";
		trace(member);
	}
}
```
We can learn from this that a variable



1. has a name (here: `member`),
2. has a type (here: `String`),
3. may have a constant initialization (here: `"bar"`) and
4. may have access modifiers ([Access Modifier](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/4.4-Access_Modifier.md)) (here: `static`)


The example first prints the initialization value of `member`, then sets it to `"foo"` before printing its new value. The effect of access modifiers is shared by all three class field kinds and explained in a separate section.

It should be noted that the explicit type is not required if there is an initialization value. The compiler will infer ([Type Inference](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.4-Type_Inference.md)) it in this case.
