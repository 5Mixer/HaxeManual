## 4.2.3 Rules for getter and setter

The visibility of an accessor method has no effect on the accessibility of its property. That is, if a property is `public` and defined to have a getter, definig the getter as `private` will have no effect on accessing the property. 
>TODO: Does the compiler throw a warning when protection levels get crossed?

  


Both getter and setter methods may access their physical field for data storage. The compiler ensures that this kind of field access does not go through the accessor method if made from within the accessor method itself, thus avoiding infinite recursion:

```haxe
class Main {
	public var x(default, set):Int;
	
	function set_x(newX) {
		return x = newX;
	}
	
	static public function main() {}
}
```
