Object declaration begins with an opening curly brace `{` after which `key:value`-pairs separated by comma `,` follow, and which ends in a closing curly brace `}`.

```
{
key1:value1,
key2:value2,
...
keyN:valueN
}
```
Further details of object declaration are described in the section about anonymous structures ([manual/Anonymous_Structure]).
