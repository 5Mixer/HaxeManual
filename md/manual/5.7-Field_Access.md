## 5.7 Field Access

Field access is expressed by using the dot `.` followed by the name of the field.

```haxe
object.fieldName
```

This syntax is also used to access types within packages in the form of `pack.Type`. 

The typer ensures that an accessed field actually exist and may apply transformations depending on the nature of the field. If a field access is ambiguous, understanding the [resolution order](3.7.3-Resolution_Order.md) may help.
