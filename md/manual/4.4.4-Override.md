## 4.4.4 Override

The access modifier `override` is required when a child class declares a field which also exists in a [parent class](2.3.2-Inheritance.md). The purpose is to ensure that overrides are obvious, even in large class hierarchies. Likewise, having `override` on a field which does not actually override anything (e.g. due to a misspelled field name) will cause a compile time error, as well.

The effects of overriding fields are detailed in [Overriding Fields](4.5-Overriding_Fields.md).
