## 4.4.4 Override

The access modifier `override` is required when a field is declared which also exists on a parent class ([Inheritance](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.3.2-Inheritance.md)). Its purpose is to ensure that the author of a class is aware of the override as this may not always be obvious in large class hierarchies. Likewise, having `override` on a field which does not actually override anything (e.g. due to a misspelled field name) triggers an error as well.

The effects of overriding fields are detailed in [Overriding Fields](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/4.5-Overriding_Fields.md).
