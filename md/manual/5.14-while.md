## 5.14 while

**while** is a standard loop that executes as long as **precondition** is true.  A **do-while** loop is a very similar construct, but operates with a **postcondition**.
```haxe
while ( precondition ){ 
  //loop
}

do{
  //loop 
} while ( postcondition );
```

For instance, here is a simple counter written as both a **while** and **do-while** loop:

```haxe

// while counter
var i = 0;
while( i < 10){
  trace(i);
  i ++;
}

// same counter as a do-while
var j = 0;
do{
  trace(j);
  j ++;
} while( j < 10 );


```

The [break](5.19-break.md) and [continue](5.20-continue.md) keywords can be used to further control the flow of a loop.
