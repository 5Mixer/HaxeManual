## 5.9 Closure

>TODO: I wrote this section, may need adjusted --C

A closure is function coupled with it's referencing environment.  A closure has access to variables that were in scope when the closure was created, even if those variables are no longer in scope.  They are useful for writing **event drive code** and are commonly found in JavaScript **callback** funtions.  

Closures are implemented in Haxe using **local functions**.

> ##### Define: Local Function
>
> A local function is declared using the **function** keyword without a name.  Local functions are values like literal integers or strings and can access local and static variables from their defining class


This is an example of declaring and calling a local function:
```haxe
var func = function{ ... };
f(); //call the function
```

Local functions can have parameters, just like a typical method.  However, they can also access static fields of their defining class and local variables defined prior to the function.

```haxe
var x = 10;
var add = function(n) { x += n; };
add(2);
add(3);
//the value of x is now 15
```

Local functions can't access the **this** value.  To access **this**, it needs to be assiged to a local variable, typically called **me**

```haxe

Class MyClass{
  var x : Int;

  function f1() {
    //Can not access 'this'.  WILL NOT COMPILE!
    var add = function(n) {this.x += n;};
  }

  function f2() {
    //will compile
    var me = this;
    var add = function(n) {me.x += n;};
  }

}



```
