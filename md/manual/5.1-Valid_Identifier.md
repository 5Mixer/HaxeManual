## 5.1 Valid Identifier

> ##### Define: Valid Identifier
>
> a valid Haxe identifier must start with an underscore `_`, a dollar `$`, a lower-case character `a-z` or an upper-case character `A-Z`. After that, any combination and number of `_`, `A-Z`, `a-z` and `0-9` may follow.
> 
> Further limitations follow from the usage context, which is checked upon typing:
> 
> 
> * Type names must start with an upper-case letter `A-Z` or an underscore `_`.
> * Leading dollars are not allowed for any kind of [name](dictionary.md#name) (dollar-names are mostly used for [macro reification](8.3-Reification.md)).
