HaxeManual
==========

Haxe is a high level, open source programming language.  See <http://haxe.org> for more information

This is a fork of the Haxe Manual. I've done some basic editing/proofreading.  I've also posed some questions where I (as a semi-newbie) got confused.  The questions show up as bubble annotations in *HaxeDoc.pdf* or as *TODO* blocks in md/manual MarkDown files.  

I'll eventually figure the qustions out, but I'd be grateful for any answers you can provide.  If you have answers, a source code example to add, caught a typo, etc, pull requests are always welcome!  Or feel free to e-mail the changes to me and I'll integrate them.  

Since this fork of the manual **is** under development, sections are liable to change... or possibly even be completely wrong!  

Official Repository
===================

Hopefully this fork will, eventually, get merged back into the official Haxe Manual.  It lives here:
