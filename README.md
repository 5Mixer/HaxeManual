HaxeManual
==========

Haxe is a high level, open source programming language.  See <http://haxe.org> for more information

This is a fork of the official Haxe manual, currently under development:
<https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual>

Since it **is** under development, sections are liable to change... or just be flat out wrong!

If you have answers to the questions blocks in *HaxeDoc.pdf* feel free to make the changes, or send them to me in some fasion.
